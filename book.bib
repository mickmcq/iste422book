		  their visual senses to be aware about their environment,
		  giving them heightened visual cognition and improved
		  attention management strategies. Thus, the eyes have shown
		  to play a significant role in these visual communication
		  practices and, therefore, many various researches have
		  adopted methodologies, specifically eye-tracking, to
		  understand the gaze patterns and analyze the behavior of
		  DHH individuals. In this paper, we provide a literature
		  review from 55 papers and data analysis from eye-tracking
		  studies concerning hearing impairment, attention management
		  strategies, and their mode of communication such as Visual
		  and Textual based communication. Through this survey, we
		  summarize the findings and provide future research

  abstract	= {Adding American Sign Language (ASL) versions of
		  information content to websites can improve information
		  accessibility for many people who are Deaf or Hard of
		  Hearing (DHH) who may have lower levels of English
		  literacy. Generating animations from a script
		  representation would enable this content to be easily
		  updated, yet software is needed that can set detailed speed
		  and timing parameters for such animations, which prior work
		  has revealed to be critical for their understandability and
		  acceptance among DHH users. Despite recent work on
		  predicting these parameters using AI models trained on
		  recordings of human signers, no prior work had examined
		  whether DHH users actually prefer for these speed and
		  timing properties to be similar to humans, or to be
		  exaggerated, e.g. for additional clarity. We conducted two
		  empirical studies to investigate preferences of ASL signers
		  for speed and timing parameters of ASL animations,
		  including: sign duration, transition time, differential
		  signing rate, pause length, and pausing frequency. Our
		  first study (N=20) identified two preferred values from
		  among five options for each parameter, one of which
		  included a typical human value for this parameter, and a
		  second study (N=20) identified the most preferred value. We
		  found that while ASL signers preferred pause length and
		  frequency to be similar to those of humans, they actually
		  preferred animations to have faster signs, slower
		  transitions, and less dynamic variation in differential
		  signing speed, as compared to the timing of human signers.
		  This study provides specific empirical guidance for
		  creators of future ASL animation technologies, and more
		  broadly, it demonstrates that it is not safe to assume that
		  ASL signers will simply prefer for properties of ASL
		  animations to be as similar as possible to human signers.},

  abstract	= {Developing educational tools aimed at children with
		  disabilities is a challenging process for designers and
		  developers because existing methodologies or frameworks do
		  not provide any pedagogical information and/or do not take
		  into account the particular needs of users with some type
		  of impairment. In this study, we propose a framework for
		  the design of tools to support teaching to children with
		  disabilities. The framework provides the necessary stages
		  for the development of tools (hardware-based or
		  software-based) and must be adapted for a specific
		  disability and educational goal. For this study, the
		  framework was adapted to support literacy teaching and
		  contributes to the design of educational/interactive
		  technology for deaf people while making them part of the
		  design process and taking into account their particular
		  needs. The experts' evaluation of the framework shows that
		  it is well structured and may be adapted for other types of
		  disabilities.},

		  provide visitors of different ages and abilities with
		  similar associations to musical experiences. Interviews
		  also revealed positive responses to haptic feedback in this

		  We found that our participants had overarching interests in

		  piloting drones. This research helps lay groundwork for

  abstract	= { Stuttering is a speech disorder which impacts the
		  personal and professional lives of millions of people
		  worldwide. To save themselves from stigma and
		  discrimination, people who stutter (PWS) may adopt
		  different strategies to conceal their stuttering. One of
		  the common strategies is word substitution where an
		  individual avoids saying a word they might stutter on and
		  use an alternative instead. This process itself can cause
		  stress and add more burden. In this work, we present
		  Fluent, an AI augmented writing tool which assists PWS in
		  writing scripts which they can speak more fluently. Fluent
		  embodies a novel active learning based method of
		  identifying words an individual might struggle pronouncing.
		  Such words are highlighted in the interface. On hovering
		  over any such word, Fluent presents a set of alternative
		  words which have similar meaning but are easier to speak.
		  The user is free to accept or ignore these suggestions.
		  Based on such user interaction (feedback), Fluent
		  continuously evolves its classifier to better suit the
		  personalized needs of each user. We evaluated our tool by
		  measuring its ability to identify difficult words for 10
		  simulated users. We found that our tool can identify
		  difficult words with a mean accuracy of over 80% in under
		  20 interactions and it keeps improving with more feedback.
		  Our tool can be beneficial for certain important life
		  situations like giving a talk, presentation, etc. The
		  source code for this tool has been made publicly accessible
		  at github.com/bhavyaghai/Fluent.},

		  cognitive or mental disabilities at some point in their
		  lives, yet people often face a variety of barriers when
		  seeking support and receiving diagnosis from healthcare
		  professionals. While prior work found that people with such
		  disabilities assess themselves using online tests and
		  assessments, it remains unknown whether and how effectively
		  these tests fill gaps in healthcare and general support
		  systems. To find out, we interviewed 17 adults with
		  cognitive or mental disabilities about their motivation for
		  and experience using online tests. We learned that online
		  tests act as an important resource that address the
		  shortcomings in support systems for people with
		  professionally diagnosed or suspected cognitive or mental
		  disabilities. In particular, online tests can lower
		  barriers to a professional diagnosis, provide valuable
		  information about the nuances of a disability, and support
		  people in forming a disability identity – an invaluable
		  step towards a positive acceptance of oneself. Our results
		  also uncovered challenges and risks that prevent people
		  with known or suspected health conditions from fully taking
		  advantage of online tests. Based on these findings, we
		  discuss how online tests can be better leveraged to support
		  people with cognitive or mental disabilities before and
		  after professional diagnosis.},

		  source of information online, yet most online videos are
		  inaccessible to blind and visually impaired (BVI) people.
		  To find videos that are accessible, or understandable
		  without additional description of the visual content, BVI
		  people in our formative studies reported that they used a
		  time-consuming trial-and-error approach: clicking on a
		  video, watching a portion, leaving the video, and repeating
		  the process. BVI people also reported video accessibility
		  heuristics that characterize accessible and inaccessible
		  videos. We instantiate 7 of the identified heuristics (2
		  audio-related, 2 video-related, and 3 audio-visual) as
		  automated metrics to assess video accessibility. We
		  collected a dataset of accessibility ratings of videos by
		  BVI people and found that our automatic video accessibility
		  metrics correlated with the accessibility ratings (Adjusted
		  R2 = 0.642). We augmented a video search interface with our
		  video accessibility metrics and predictions. BVI people
		  using our augmented video search interface selected an
		  accessible video more efficiently than when using the
		  original search interface. By integrating video
		  accessibility metrics, video hosting platforms could help
		  people surface accessible videos and encourage content
		  creators to author more accessible products, improving
		  video accessibility for all.},

		  equal from child to child. Having access to a place to play
		  is a challenge for marginalized children, such as children
		  with disabilities. For autistic children, playing with
		  other children in the physical world may be uncomfortable
		  or even painful. Yet, having practice in the social skills
		  play provides is essential for childhood development. In
		  this ethnographic work, I explore how one community uses
		  the sense of place and the digital embodied experience in a
		  virtual world specifically to give autistic children access
		  to play with their peers. The contribution of this work is
		  twofold. First, I demonstrate how various physical and
		  virtual spaces work together to make play possible. Second,
		  I demonstrate these spaces, though some of them are
		  digital, are no more or less "real" than the physical
		  spaces making up a schoolyard or playground.},

		  non-disabled populations, producing an environment where

		  when they clash with normative ways of approaching

		  treated as invalid. This epistemic violence has manifest
		  material consequences for our lives as disabled researchers
		  engaging with work on our own states of being. Through a
		  series of vignettes, we illustrate our experiences and the
		  associated pain that comes with such engagement as well as
		  the consequences of pervasive dehumanization of ourselves
		  through existing works. Our aim is to identify the
		  epistemic injustice disabled people experience within HCI,
		  to question the epistemological base of knowledge
		  production leading to said injustice and to take ownership
		  of a narrative that all too often is created without our
		  participation.},

  abstract	= { Many accessibility features available on mobile platforms
		  require applications (apps) to provide complete and
		  accurate metadata describing user interface (UI)
		  components. Unfortunately, many apps do not provide
		  sufficient metadata for accessibility features to work as
		  expected. In this paper, we explore inferring accessibility
		  metadata for mobile apps from their pixels, as the visual
		  interfaces often best reflect an app’s full
		  functionality. We trained a robust, fast, memory-efficient,
		  on-device model to detect UI elements using a dataset of
		  77,637 screens (from 4,068 iPhone apps) that we collected
		  and annotated. To further improve UI detections and add
		  semantic information, we introduced heuristics (e.g., UI
		  grouping and ordering) and additional models (e.g.,
		  recognize UI content, state, interactivity). We built
		  Screen Recognition to generate accessibility metadata to
		  augment iOS VoiceOver. In a study with 9 screen reader
		  users, we validated that our approach improves the
		  accessibility of existing mobile apps, enabling even
		  previously inaccessible apps to be used. },
